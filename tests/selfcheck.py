"""
The framework checked against itself.

    python tests/selfcheck.py

The validator skips `templates/` and `schemas/`, for good reasons written down in the
registry, and the cost of that is real: nothing was checking the templates that everything
else is validated against, which is how `RLM.yaml` went without `status` and `owners`
without anybody noticing. This file is what closes that hole. It runs in CI.

No pytest: one dependency fewer, and the output is meant to be read by a person who has
just broken something.
